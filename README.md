# Bank Failure Prediction: A Data-Driven Exploration
This project aims to identify factors associated with bank failure and assistance using historical data from the FDIC. By comparing the characteristics of failed banks to those requiring assistance, we can develop a model to predict potential financial instability.
## Data Source: 
Historical bank data from 1934 to 2017 is obtained from the FDIC website: https://www.fdic.gov (Home > Resources > Data Tools > Bank Failures & Assistance Data).
## Key Terms:
- Bank Failure: A bank that can no longer meet its financial obligations to depositors and creditors.
- Bank Assistance: Financial aid provided by the FDIC to prevent a struggling bank from failing.
# Project Goals:
-	Analyze financial ratios, capital adequacy metrics, and other relevant data points to identify factors associated with bank failures and assistance.
-	Build a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict potential bank instability based on these factors.
-	Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
# Benefits:
This project contributes to a broader understanding of bank failures and assists in developing early warning systems for financial regulators.
