Analyzing banking data


Courtesy of Google's BARD artificial intelligence:

## Here are some ideas for data science projects to create using data on banks that failed and banks that needed assistance:

1. Develop a predictive model for bank failure. This project would involve using a variety of data mining techniques to identify patterns and risk factors that are associated with bank failure. You could then use these patterns and risk factors to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of failure for other banks.

2. Analyze the factors that contribute to bank failure. This project would involve using statistical techniques to identify the factors that are most strongly associated with bank failure. You could then use this information to develop recommendations for how to prevent bank failures.

3. Develop a risk assessment tool for banks. This project would involve developing a tool that bankers can use to assess the risk of failure for their own banks. The tool could be based on a variety of factors, such as the bank's financial condition, its management practices, and the economic environment.

4. Compare the characteristics of banks that failed to those of banks that needed assistance. This project would involve comparing the characteristics of banks that failed to those of banks that needed assistance. You could then use this information to identify factors that are associated with both failure and assistance.

5. Develop a system for early detection of bank failure. This project would involve developing a system that can identify banks that are at risk of failure before they actually fail. The system could be based on a variety of factors, such as changes in the bank's financial condition, changes in its management practices, or changes in the economic environment.
